#CQRS Demo
CQRS Demo project, derived from CQRS Lite https://github.com/gautema/CQRSlite
## The framework

CQRSlite is a small CQRS and Eventsourcing Framework. It is written in C# and targets .NET 4.0. CQRSlite originated as a CQRS sample project Greg Young and I did in the autumn of 2010.
This code is located at http://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r

CQRSlite has been made with pluggability in mind. So every standard implementation should be interchangeable with a custom one if needed.

##Getting started

A sample project is located with the code, this shows a common usage scenario of the framework. There are some features of CQRSlite, such as snapshotting that the sample does not show. These features are only documented through the tests.

The project should compile without any setup in .NET 4.0 or Mono 2.10.4.
